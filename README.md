# 3D-OCT-Brain-Tissue-Scans-Registration-
dftregistration3D Function for 3D-OCT scans registration based on the cross correlation matrix between the volumes.

# Approach
3D registration based on Sub-Pixel DFT matrix multiplication using black borders padding Sub-Volumes stiching function.
1. SubPixel DFT matrix multiplication: Use upsampling factor to enable half pixel shift values for upsfac=2, or more accurate tiny shift values using DFT matrix mutiplication within a predefined neighboring window size using the first shift estimate from usfac=2 step. 
2. Black borders Padding: By padding the moved volume in x, y, and z with a padding size equal to half of the sub-volume size to avoid the negative shift values and maintain the registration process being as  accurate as possible.
3. Sub-Volumes stching: After the registration is done, the subvolumes are needed to be stiched together to form the main registered volume with the size of the original reference volume.

# Function Parameters
## Usfac: For more accurate registration results, upsampling factor need to be greater than 2 for smaller Sub-Volumes, however in the case that the hardware system is doing upsampling. Then software upsampling is no longer required.
## Cut-off sub-volume: The minimum Cut-Off should be at least 50, 200, 200 in Y, X, and Z for better features retaining in the    registered Sub-Volumes.
    - X = 200; % pixels in X-axis / number of A-scans
    - Y = 200; % pixels in Y-axis / A-scan length
    - Z = 75;   % pixels in Z-axis / number of B-scans  (Higher frame size leads to better accuracies)
## neighbor_window_size: The size of the window beyond which the first estimate shift values are updated in case of DFT matrix multiplication.
    - 1.5 in 2D , 15 pixels window
    - 0.3737 in 3D , 4 pixels window which is much smaller than in 2D to avoid the multible optimal points in larger window sizes.
## Subpixel_Zshift: Supixels in Z axis lead to to blurry images.
